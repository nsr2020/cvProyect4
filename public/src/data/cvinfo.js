  aboutMe:
    "I love travelling, meeting new people and above all finding my inner peace, so that I can manage my day to day life in a way that is healthier for me. I have been working in Customer Service for many years, but I had studied Computer Science a few years ago. Because of this, I decided it was time to pick up where I left off and reinvent myself professionally. I love programming and I think I can achieve very nice things in the future.",
